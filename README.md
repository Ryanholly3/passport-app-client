View repository for project back-end [HERE](https://github.com/Ryanholly3/passport-app-api).

## Description
Travel app that allows users to plan trips with friends.

Upon logging in to the app, users view their dashboard - a google map that has their saved travel destinations pinned. Upon clicking the map, the user drops a pin to mark a new location they'd like to travel to. Users can also view the locations that other users have pinned, allowing them to coordinate travel plans.
