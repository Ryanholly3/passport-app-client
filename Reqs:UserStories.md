# Best Practices

* Written from the USER'S perspective
* Focus on user experience
	- Leave out technical details & jargon
* Template:
	- As a (type) of user, I want (goal or objective/feature), so that (benefit or value)
* Be specific (not vague)
	- Be targeted & measurable
	- Acceptance criteria
* Be mindfulf of 'Epic stories'
	- Often an opportunity to split into smaller stories
* Story can never be too small.
	- Easier to target
	- Sense of accomplishment
